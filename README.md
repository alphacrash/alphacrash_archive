### Hi, I am [SUD](https://alphacrash.com/). 🌱

I am full stack developer mostly spending my time on React, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

If I'm not coding on weekdays, then probably I will be playing Valorant and FIFA. On weekend, you can't catch me! (likely trekking on some hill with no network 👻)

## Technology I work on

- Language - JavaScript, Java, SQL
- Framework - React, Spring Boot
- Database - PostgreSQL
- DevOps Tools - Git, Docker, Kubernetes
- Platforms - GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure, AWS, RedHat OCP, Jenkins
