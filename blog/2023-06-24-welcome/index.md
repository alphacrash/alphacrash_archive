### 1 - Organize information

While I was prepping up for interviews, there were numerous sites that helped me.
Some free and some paid.
I felt some paid contents were better. But why?
Did they give any extra knowledge that I couldn't get for free?

- I settled on the answer that they organized all the information which helped the learner. Just this small change made a huge difference in productivity.

### 2 - Give back to community

I have worked few years on this industry and now know a thing or two.
I thought maybe can I help atleast one person like me who just wants to understand something easily.

### 3 - Make something cool

I really loved making the SQL Runner part, even though the backbone was `SQL.js`. Developing the application that any person can practice immediately was really exciting for me.

### 4 - Place for me to review

I want to come back to this place to review and practice before any other site if I go for an interview somewhere.
