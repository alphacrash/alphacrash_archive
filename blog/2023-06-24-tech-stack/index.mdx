### Packages I used

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The UI library. The soul of the website.
2. [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - I just have to write the content. Docusaurus takes care of rest.
3. [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - It makes state management easier compared to default React hooks.
4. [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - Comprehensive suite of UI tools that helps me build faster.
5. [SQL.js](https://sql.js.org/) - The SQL Database. Heart of the Practice SQL section

### Deployment

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - I have used Vercel for deployment. It is easy to use and has a free tier.

:::caution Challenges

1. Polyfills

   - SQL.js requires polyfills for WebAssembly. I had to manually add the configuration to webpack.
   - I took me considerate amount of time fixing and debugging the issues.

2. Finding a ready made platform that I can customize too
   - Previously I had used Gatsby.js but it had lot of features and too much of a learning curve.
   - I was looking for something that is simple and easy to customize. Next.js looked good.
   - Docusaurus was the perfect fit.
